Here is a quick summary of who this module is for, what it contains, how to engage, and why we designed it. 

**Who:** Open to anyone interested in inclusive and equitable education, and especially designed for those in teaching roles (faculty, teaching staff, teaching assistants/fellows), but not necessarily limited to those in higher education.

**What:** In this online module and associated blended workshop, you can explore why inclusive teaching is relevant and important by articulating the multiple intersecting identities you hold, and reflecting upon how your identities influence your experiences with education. We introduce reflective teaching through a framework of how to critically examine specific teaching practices, which you can try yourself. The online module and workshop include opportunities to practice distinguishing inclusive practices from less inclusive practices, and identifying why common teaching practices may or may not be inclusive through scenario-based assessments with elaborate explanations. The online module and workshop are capped with an action plan and annotated resources for you to think through the next steps in your inclusive teaching development.

**How:** You have three options for using this material.

1. Explore the module at your own pace, guided by the topics that interest you most. We understand that not everyone wants to or has time to engage in all aspects of the course. 
2. Facilitate a blended workshop using the online module. Follow the {{% resource_link "908a3ff7-5baa-4dea-aea8-01f0fc86e1aa" "Facilitation Guide (PDF)" %}} and {{% resource_link "06280655-3b6b-4b9e-95eb-5f66f34fea33" "Appendix file (ZIP)" %}} to learn how to lead participants through in-person and online activities that will build their inclusive teaching skills. 
3. Participant in a blended workshop. Engage locally in your home institution’s version of this blended workshop. 

**Why:** We believe in the power of open education, active learning, and inclusive teaching. Both the online module and blended workshop go beyond sharing tips or lists on how to teach in an inclusive manner, and promote mindsets and processes for evaluating pedagogical choices. In sharing these resources openly, we hope to encourage more broadly the ability to empathize with students, evaluate instructional choices, and reflect on what inclusive teaching means in various teaching environments.
